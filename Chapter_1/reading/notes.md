  - "Sensors and Sensing: A Biologist's View"
    - "Introduction"
      - "Animals have developed a stunning diversity of sensory systems to gain the information they need."
      - "All sensors absorb some kind of energy (an exception being cold receptors responding to loss of thermal energy), typically in minute quantity, and generate electrical signals."
      - "In all but the phylogenetically most primitive animals, these signals carry the information to a central nervous system for further processing and filtering, for planning, initiating, or modifying motor actions, or just being stored in the memory for future nervous activity and for behaviour."
    - "Basics"
      - "The sequence of events that lies between the uptake of a particular stimulus and the generation of electrochemical signals such as action potentials is the following in all cases of biological sensors:"
        - "Stimulus Uptake and Transformation"
          - "There are structures designed to absorb energy of a particular form and pass it on to the sensory cells (i.e. stimulus uptake)"
          - "While doing this, they transform the stimulus in a way that makes it suitable for being taken up by the sensory cells (i.e. stimulus transformation)"
          - "The form of energy of the input stimulus does not change"
        - "Stimulus Transduction"
          - "Compared to stimulus transformation, the process of stimulus transduction is much more uniform across the spectrum of biological sensors."
          - "the energy form of the already-transformed (modified) stimulus is transduced into the electro-chemical form of a nervous signal"
          - "The structure where this happens is the membrane of the sensory cell"
          - "An essential feature of membranes of all living cells is that they represent a condenser/capacitor (with a capacitance of about 1 $$\mu F$$ per $$cm^2$$)"
            - "which, due to an active process (the electrogenic Na+/K+ pump) using up the metabolic energy, separates ions and thus charges in the cell interior from those in the extracellular medium"
          - "The results are concentration gradients"
            - "e.g. for Na+: K+, and Cl- across the cell member which, combined with a selective permeability for K+, leads to a so called resting membrane potential of about roughly 40 to 90 mV, the inside of the member being negative relative to the outside"
          - "The specialization of sensory cells is that their respective adequate stimulus modulates a resistance (conductivity) in the membrane and in a circuit which is driven by the batteries across the member."
          - "Importantly, the processes of transduction and signal generation are **not** driven by the energy contained in the stimulus"
          - "Instead, the stimulus mainly serves to modulate a resistance **r** in a gating process similar to the turning of a water hose (valve) which is not the driving force behind the actual water flow out of the tap"
          - "Sometimes the electrical current is not only driven by the batteries across the sensory cell membrane alone but in addition by specialized auxiliary cells and tissues."
          - "A conductance (1/r) change (i.e. change in resistance) of the sensory cell membrane is a common feature of sensors taking up such different types of energy."
          - "Its consequence is a so-called receptor potential of some 20 mV which is nothing but a change in the resting potential."
          - "The receptor potential is a graded phenomenon. "
            - "It changes amplitude with stimulus strength and also with the temporal and spatial pattern of the incoming stimuli"
        - "Encoding"
          - "In most cases of sensors, though not in all, information about the stimulus is carried by so called action potentials. "
          - "As soon as the receptor potential (called a generator potential) has reached a threshold value the Na+ conductance of the membrane suddenly (due to a positive feedback loop) increases about 1000-fold."
          - "This sudden change is due to voltage sensitive Na+ - channels and leads to an explosive complete depolarization and even a reversal of the resting membrane potential."
            - "This event is the action potential"
            - "It lasts for not much more than one millisecond"
            - "After about two milliseconds, the resting potential returns to its normal "unstimulated" value."
          - "Action potentials differ from generator potentials in that they are all - or - nothing phenomena with essentially always the same size and thus ^^assuming the properties of digital instead of analog signals^^. "
          - "The information about the stimulus is encoded in the ^^temporal pattern^^ of successive action potentials referred to as action potential frequency and its modulation."
          - "This is independent of the type of stimulus energy taken up by the sensory organ."
            - "Same in all living organisms"
          - "How does the brain distinguish stimulus quality? For instance, is it a visual or an acoustic stimulus?"
            - "The answer to this fundamental question lies in the specificity of connections."
            - "The main advantage of using the frequency modulation code and "digital" action potentials is the resulting insensitivity towards background noise, at the expense of temporal resolution at low frequencies."
          - "Another general property of most biological sensors is that much more weight is given to the dynamic properties of the stimulus than its static ones."
            - "i.e., it is in particular the change in environmental properties which the sensor responds to and which the organism needs to know"
    - "Membrane Channels"
      - "Like action potentials, the receptor potential and thus transduction is closely linked to membrane channels which upon stimulation of the sensor change their conductance allowing currents in the range of picoamperes while open. "

    - "Sensitivity"
      - "A striking feature of many biological sensors is their outstanding sensitivity"
        - "This corresponds to a voltage of 1V over 1 000 km "
    - "Selectivity and Meaning"
      - "One of the most biologically relevant features of animal sensors and indeed the main source of their striking diversity is the seemingly simple notion that there is no information without meaning"
      - "Biological sensors reflect the needs of the animal"
      - "In order to fully understand a sensory system the stimuli have to be found and applied which the system evolved to process"
    - "Richness and Diversity"
      - "Humans often think they're the centre, but we're just one paprt of nature. And nature has tons of organisms who have sensors much better than we do."
      - "For this and other reasons, senses must not be classified according to human perceptions but according to the form of energy of the respective adequate stimulus."
    - "The Link Between Biology and Engineering"
      - "You don't need specialized training to see "technical efficiency and perfection" in nature"
      - "What can engineers and biologists learn from each other?"
        - "1. Technical biology"
        - "2. Bionics"
          - "The idea to use nature as a model for human technology"
          - "The motivation is highly justified because animals and plants and machines are all subject to the same laws of physics"
          - "As a rule, the engineer will not find ready made "instructions" of how to build a device in nature."
          - "Nature, however, offers a multitude of ideas of how to solve a problem."
          - "In many cases, evolution seems to have found practically any solution principally possible."
          - "The effort to explicitly transform a biological solution of a problem into a technical construction is the essence of bionics. "
          - "From a biologist's point of view the impression prevails that the most intriguing diversity in animal sense organs is not so much found in the cellular transduction processes proper (which are quite conservative over evolutionary times) but in stimulus transformation"
        - "3. Difficulties"
          - "When an engineer has to design something he or she typically knows precisely what the goals are and the conditions under which they have to be reached."
          - "Biological research very often is a kind of "backward engineering" dealing with a complex ready-made structure whose detailed functions and "design" principles very often are all but clear."
          - "Clearly, "design" is the wrong terminology in biology."
          - "Evolution does not "design"."
            - "It works under a multitude of diverse selective pressures, with errors and variation being associated with the passing on of genetic information to the next generation, and in many small steps over long stretches of time."
          - "We call the sensors, that have resulted from this process matched filters because their properties serve the particular needs of a particular animal species performing a particular behaviour in its particular species- specific habitat"
          - "The process leading to matched structures and functions is blind regarding its "goal", not teleological, and not design, but rather trial and error and tinkering."
          - "There is no brain which would think before a sensor is built."
          - "While wondering that so much "perfection", high-tech, and harmony is obviously at work in nature and in many instances clearly ahead of technology we should never forget that evolution has been tinkering since about 3 billion years and its products have been quality controlled for the same period of time."
